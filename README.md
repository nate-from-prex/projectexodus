# Project Exodus

The mission of this Github page is to learn the principles of efficient coding through application as well as building a highly effective tool. In a world that is so consumed by technology to make life more efficient, I believe that an open-source solution should work to create more applications, personability, app integrations, and beauty. People should be able to contribute in ways that they want in their life so that it affects other people. So, Project Exodus, named for its ability to free people from the mundane aspects of life, was created. People can contribute, download and integrate into their own lives, and bootstrap to their needs with future coming developer tools. 

Parts in process
1. Accounts to automatically login, access login credentials, and codes to your most important applications
2. Tasks with unique customizations for different aspects of your life
3. Notes system with more app plugins than any alternative on the market (boards, files, popular apps, unsplash, mailchimp, etc.)
4. Team Processes for sharing in your organizations and practices
5. API integrations (Weather, Spotify song pickers, Random image of the day generator, Daily Bible Verse generator, etc.)
6. Personability functionalities


If you believe in this and want to incorporate it into your own life, please feel free to contribute to these projects and help build this
